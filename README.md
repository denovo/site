## Javascript libraries used & descriptions 

A list of all libraries that are used on the UAL website. Please add to this list each time you add a new script to the Assets folder.


### [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com)

** used in _____ pages **

Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser. 
Used to provide fallback for browsers which don't support some of the latest features.

How it works
Modernizr runs quickly on page load to detect features; it then creates a JavaScript object with the results, and adds classes to the html element for you to key your CSS on. Modernizr supports dozens of tests, and optionally includes YepNope.js for conditional loading of external .js and .css resources.


### [hoverintent.js](http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html)

** used in _____ pages **

hoverIntent is a plug-in that attempts to determine the user's intent... like a crystal ball, only with mouse movement! It is similar to jQuery's hover method. However, instead of calling the handlerIn function immediately, hoverIntent waits until the user's mouse slows down enough before making the call. 


### [response.js](http://responsejs.com)

** used in _____ pages **

Response is a jQuery plugin that provides tools for building performance-optimized, mobile-first responsive websites. Its breakpoint sets use HTML5 data attributes to dynamically swap markup based on breakpoints so that rich content can be served progressively. Its API includes cross-browser event hooks, HTML5 dataset, and ways to get or test responsive properties.
