## Javascript libraries used & descriptions 

A list of all libraries that are used on the UAL website. Please add to this list each time you add a new script to the Assets folder.


### [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com)

** used in _____ pages **

Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser. 
Used to provide fallback for browsers which don't support some of the latest features.

How it works
Modernizr runs quickly on page load to detect features; it then creates a JavaScript object with the results, and adds classes to the html element for you to key your CSS on. Modernizr supports dozens of tests, and optionally includes YepNope.js for conditional loading of external .js and .css resources.
