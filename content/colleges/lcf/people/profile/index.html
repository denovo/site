						<h4>What do you love most about LCF?&nbsp;</h4>
						<p>Studying at London College of Fashion has given me so much. Throughout my studies the tutors have really encouraged me to grow as a designer. I was so humbled when I was chosen for the press show, itâ€™s such a great opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
						<h4>What was the inspiration for your collection?</h4>
						<p>The inspiration behind my designs comes from childhood fantasy, family and home. I like to experiment with everything I design and make. I create something new and exciting whilst also expressing myself as an artist. In this collection I have used wadding and sheep skin, and balanced it against loud digital prints. The collection is styled with loud accessories which accentuates the sense of fun. I have used perfectly dyed fur and mad eccentric colours. I wanted to create an eye-catching collection, which is also elegant.&nbsp;</p>
						<h4>What are your plans for the future?&nbsp;</h4>
						<p>I am influenced by JW Anderson and Christopher Kane, and my dream job would to be work with high-end womenswear brands.&nbsp;</p>
