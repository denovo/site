			<h3>Why did you choose BA Textile Design at Chelsea?</h3>
			<p>The Chelsea campus has a great feel to it; it is small but perfectly formed!</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom-x8">The studios are so bright and spacious that you actually want to spend time in them. I always felt so inspired to get to work when I walked through the door.</p>

			<h3>How did you choose your course?</h3>
			<p>From a young age I had always thought that I would study fashion. After my Foundation course I started a fashion womenswear course at another university, but after a few weeks felt that it was not for me.</p> 
			<p>I took a year out to help me decide what I wanted to do. Working solidly that whole year as an intern in various fashion houses, and learning a lot about the industry, I came to the conclusion that textile design was the area I was most interested in. </p>
			<p>I realised then, just as I do now that textiles allow you to engage fully with the body and the environment. Consequently I applied to a selection of very good universities, and ended up gaining a place at the one I wanted the most! </p>

			<h3>Most memorable moment at Chelsea?</h3>
			<p>My most memorable moment at Chelsea was in my second year whilst on-route to Premier Vision Paris, where Chelsea had a stand to exhibit and sell our work. </p>
			<p>I received a text message from a friend telling me that I had sold 4 samples to KENZO, all before I had even set foot off the Eurostar! </p>
			<p>The prints then went on to be used heavily in their S/S 2011 campaign.  </p>

			<h3>Best advice you were given whilst at Chelsea?</h3>
			<p>My main tutor at Chelsea was Kathy Round. I have had a few great tutors in my creative life and she was one of the best. She taught me to follow my ideas and thoughts through to being realised. </p>
			<p>Some of my starting points for projects can be a little obscure and she was very supportive in helping me to see that this was key to my design process. </p>
