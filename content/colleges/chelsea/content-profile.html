			<h3>Why did you choose BA Textile Design at Chelsea?</h3>
			<p>The Chelsea campus has a great feel to it; it is small but perfectly formed!</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom-x8">The studios are so bright and spacious that you actually want to spend time in them. I always felt so inspired to get to work when I walked through the door.</p>

			<h3>How did you choose your course?</h3>
			<p>From a young age I had always thought that I would study fashion. After my Foundation course I started a fashion womenswear course at another university, but after a few weeks felt that it was not for me.</p> 
			<p>I took a year out to help me decide what I wanted to do. Working solidly that whole year as an intern in various fashion houses, and learning a lot about the industry, I came to the conclusion that textile design was the area I was most interested in. </p>
			<p>I realised then, just as I do now that textiles allow you to engage fully with the body and the environment. Consequently I applied to a selection of very good universities, and ended up gaining a place at the one I wanted the most! </p>

			<h3>Most memorable moment at Chelsea?</h3>
			<p>My most memorable moment at Chelsea was in my second year whilst on-route to Premier Vision Paris, where Chelsea had a stand to exhibit and sell our work. </p>
			<p>I received a text message from a friend telling me that I had sold 4 samples to KENZO, all before I had even set foot off the Eurostar! </p>
			<p>The prints then went on to be used heavily in their S/S 2011 campaign.  </p>

			<h3>Best advice you were given whilst at Chelsea?</h3>
			<p>My main tutor at Chelsea was Kathy Round. I have had a few great tutors in my creative life and she was one of the best. She taught me to follow my ideas and thoughts through to being realised. </p>
			<p>Some of my starting points for projects can be a little obscure and she was very supportive in helping me to see that this was key to my design process. </p>

			<h3>Tips for Chelsea students</h3>
			<ol class="large-li-numbers">
				<li>
					<p>Remember to stay true to your ideas and style, these are two things you should put your trust in, let them guide you - its all you have, its everything! Try not to let the knocks and disappointments phase you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If you feel that an idea, process or style that you have been working on may be being copied by another designer or colleague, take this as a compliment and move on and forward to bigger and better things.</p> 
					<p>As a designer your work and ideas are constantly evolving so don’t dwell on anyone who is influenced by you along the way, feel safe in the knowledge that your best ideas are always yet to come.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Use the Chelsea workshops! These are an amazing resource to have and you will miss them when you leave. I know that it can feel intimidating to venture down into the workshop and ask for help, but there are people there with a wealth of knowledge and skill and they are there to help you. </p>
