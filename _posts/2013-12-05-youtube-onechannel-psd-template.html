    <p class="lead">This sounds fantastic, and it is, however here we are again, trying to brand our YouTube channel pages again. Now the guys at Google have provided some guidance to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2972003?hl=en&topic=16630" title="Channel Art Guidelines">how to design your cover art for the channel <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> however they don’t provide an actual PSD template to work from. So here it is, a PSD template for designers to spring their designs from, with guides included, we hope this helps – along with reading the Google guide of course.</p>
    <p>We created a cover image for Results With Lucy, from their web analytics, many of their visitors would tend to be using their mobile devices, however we’ve allowed for the graphic to appear just as good on T.V screens should users be visiting YouTube on their smart TVs or Mobile.</p>
    <p>Feel free to drop us a line if you have any questions, or if you would prefer us to do the hard graft for you; hey that’s what we’re here for!</p>
