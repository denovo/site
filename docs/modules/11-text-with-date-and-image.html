					<p>David Bowie Is, the first major retrospective on David Bowie’s career, has been acclaimed by critics and is the Victoria and Albert Museum’s fastest selling exhibition. Victoria Broackes, co-curator and Head of Theatre and Performance exhibitions at the V&A, will discuss the development of the exhibition and put it in the context of the V&A’s rock and pop collections and broader display programme. As well as giving insights into the making of the exhibition she will explore the challenges, and value, of displaying pop culture at the V&A, the world’s largest museum of art and design.</p>
