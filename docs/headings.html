                    <h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
                    <p>The main page header of this guide is an <code>h1</code> element. Any header elements may include links, as depicted in the example.</p>
                    <p>The secondary header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header. More than one may be used per page. Consider using an <code>h2</code> unless you need a header level of less importance, or as a sub-header to an existing <code>h2</code> element.</p>
                    <h3>Third-Level Header</h3>
                    <p>The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
                    <h4>Fourth-Level Header</h4>
                    <p>The header above is an <code>h4</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
                    <h5>Fifth-Level Header</h5>
                    <p>The header above is an <code>h5</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
                    <h6>Sixth-Level Header</h6>
                    <p>The header above is an <code>h6</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
                    
                    <h2 id="grouping">Grouping content</h2>
                    <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
                    <p>All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags. Additionally, <code>p</code> elements can be wrapped with a <code>blockquote</code> element <em>if the <code>p</code> element is indeed a quote</em>. Historically, <code>blockquote</code> has been used purely to force indents, but this is now achieved using CSS. Reserve <code>blockquote</code> for quotes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Horizontal rule</h3>
                    <p>The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. The following extract from <cite>Pandora’s Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton shows two paragraphs that precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it:</p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
                        <p><i>Maybe it won’t be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night’s shift.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond’s winters.</p>
